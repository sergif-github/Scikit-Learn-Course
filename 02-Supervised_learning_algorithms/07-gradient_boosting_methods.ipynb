    "# Module 1: Introduction to Scikit-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 2: Supervised Learning Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 7: Gradient Boosting Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will explore Gradient Boosting methods, a family of powerful ensemble learning algorithms used for both classification and regression tasks. Gradient Boosting combines multiple weak learners to create a strong predictive model. Let's dive in!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.1 Understanding Gradient Boosting Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that builds an additive model by sequentially training weak learners on the residuals of the previous learners. Each weak learner is trained to correct the mistakes made by the previous learners, focusing on the instances that are difficult to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting methods work by optimizing a loss function using gradient descent. The model's objective is to minimize the loss function by iteratively adding weak learners to the ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different variants of Gradient Boosting methods exist, such as Gradient Boosting Classifier (for classification tasks) and Gradient Boosting Regressor (for regression tasks). Popular implementations include XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.2 Training and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a Gradient Boosting model, we need a labeled dataset with the target variable and the corresponding feature values. The model learns by iteratively adding weak learners to the ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once trained, we can evaluate the model's performance using evaluation metrics suitable for classification or regression tasks, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, or area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn provides the GradientBoostingClassifier class for classification tasks and the GradientBoostingRegressor class for regression tasks. Here's an example of how to use them:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier, GradientBoostingRegressor\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an instance of the GradientBoostingClassifier or GradientBoostingRegressor model\n",
    "classifier = GradientBoostingClassifier()\n",
    "regressor = GradientBoostingRegressor()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fit the model to the training data\n",
    "classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Predict class labels or values for test data\n",
    "y_pred_classifier = classifier.predict(X_test)\n",
    "y_pred_regressor = regressor.predict(X_test)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluate the model's performance\n",
    "classification_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_classifier)\n",
    "regression_mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_regressor)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.3 Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting models have various hyperparameters that can be tuned to improve performance. These include the learning rate, number of estimators (weak learners), maximum depth of the trees, regularization parameters, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameter tuning can be performed using techniques like grid search or randomized search. Scikit-Learn provides tools like GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to efficiently search through the hyperparameter space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.4 Feature Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting methods can provide insights into feature importance. By analyzing the contribution of each feature across the ensemble, we can identify the most influential features in the predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn provides the feature_importances_ attribute that can be accessed after training a Gradient Boosting model to retrieve the feature importance scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.5 Handling Imbalanced Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting methods can be adapted to handle imbalanced classes through techniques like class weighting or oversampling and undersampling strategies. Specialized implementations like XGBoost and LightGBM also provide options to address class imbalance effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.6 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting methods are powerful ensemble learning algorithms for classification and regression tasks. They build an additive model by sequentially training weak learners on the residuals of the previous learners. Scikit-Learn provides the necessary classes to implement Gradient Boosting easily. Understanding the concepts, training, and evaluation techniques is crucial for effectively using Gradient Boosting methods in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next part, we will explore Neural Networks using Scikit-Learn's Multi-Layer Perceptron, a popular algorithm for complex learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to practice implementing Gradient Boosting methods using Scikit-Learn. Experiment with different hyperparameter settings, evaluation metrics, and techniques to gain a deeper understanding of the algorithms and their performance."
