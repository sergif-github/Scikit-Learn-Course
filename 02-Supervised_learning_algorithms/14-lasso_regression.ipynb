    "### Part 14: Lasso Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we will explore Lasso regression, a linear regression technique that performs both variable selection and regularization by adding an L1 penalty term to the ordinary least squares objective function. Lasso regression promotes sparse models by shrinking some coefficients to zero. Let's dive in!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14.1 Understanding Lasso regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso regression, also known as L1 regularization, is a linear regression technique that extends ordinary least squares regression by adding an L1 penalty term to the objective function. The L1 penalty promotes sparsity in the model by driving some coefficients to exactly zero. As a result, Lasso regression performs variable selection, allowing us to identify the most important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind Lasso regression is to find a balance between fitting the training data well and keeping the model coefficients small. By adding the L1 penalty term, Lasso regression encourages sparse models, effectively excluding irrelevant or redundant features from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14.2 Training and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a Lasso regression model, we need a labeled dataset with the target variable and the corresponding feature values. The model learns by minimizing the regularized objective function, which includes the sum of squared residuals from the ordinary least squares regression and the L1 penalty term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once trained, we can use the Lasso regression model to make predictions for new, unseen data points. The model predicts the target values based on the learned coefficients and the feature values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn provides the Lasso class for performing Lasso regression. Here's an example of how to use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an instance of the Lasso regression model\n",
    "lasso_regression = Lasso(alpha=1.0)  # alpha is the regularization parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fit the model to the training data\n",
    "lasso_regression.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Predict target values for test data\n",
    "y_pred = lasso_regression.predict(X_test)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluate the model's performance\n",
    "mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)\n",
    "r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14.3 Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso regression has a hyperparameter called alpha that controls the strength of the regularization. Higher values of alpha result in stronger regularization and more coefficients being shrunk to zero. The choice of the alpha value depends on the trade-off between bias and variance. Cross-validation techniques, such as grid search or randomized search, can be used to find the optimal value of alpha.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14.4 Dealing with Multicollinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso regression can be particularly useful when dealing with multicollinearity, a situation where the predictor variables are highly correlated. By shrinking some coefficients to zero, Lasso regression performs automatic variable selection, excluding irrelevant or redundant features from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14.5 Feature Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended to scale the features before applying Lasso regression. Scaling ensures that all features are on a similar scale, preventing some features from dominating the regularization process. StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler can be used to scale the features appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14.6 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso regression is a powerful technique for linear regression tasks, offering both variable selection and regularization. It adds an L1 penalty term to the objective function, promoting sparse models by shrinking some coefficients to zero. Scikit-Learn provides the necessary classes to implement Lasso regression easily. Understanding the concepts, training, and evaluation techniques is crucial for effectively using Lasso regression in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next part, we will explore ElasticNet regression, a linear regression technique that combines the benefits of both Lasso and Ridge regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to practice implementing Lasso regression using Scikit-Learn. Experiment with different values of alpha, feature scaling methods, and evaluation metrics to gain a deeper understanding of the algorithm and its performance."
