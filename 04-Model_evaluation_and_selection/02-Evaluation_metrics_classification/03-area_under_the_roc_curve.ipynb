    "### Part 3: Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we will explore the concept of Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC), a widely used evaluation metric for binary classification models. AUC-ROC measures the performance of a model in distinguishing between the two classes by plotting the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Understanding AUC-ROC is crucial for assessing the discriminative power of binary classifiers. Let's dive in!\n",

    "### 3.1 Understanding Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC curve is a graphical representation of a binary classifier's performance at various classification thresholds. It plots the True Positive Rate (Recall) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) as the classification threshold is varied. The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) represents the area under this curve, ranging from 0 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "A perfect classifier has an AUC-ROC of 1, indicating that it achieves a True Positive Rate of 1 (perfect recall) and a False Positive Rate of 0. A random classifier has an AUC-ROC of 0.5, as it performs no better than chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Interpreting AUC-ROC\n",
    "\n",
    "AUC-ROC provides an overall measure of the classifier's ability to distinguish between the two classes. Higher AUC-ROC values indicate better discriminative power of the classifier. AUC-ROC is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets, as it is less affected by class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Using AUC-ROC in Scikit-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn provides the roc_auc_score function to calculate the AUC-ROC. Here's an example of how to use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assuming y_true and y_scores are the true labels and predicted scores (probabilities), respectively\n",
    "auc_roc = roc_auc_score(y_true, y_scores)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) is a crucial evaluation metric for binary classification models. It measures the ability of the classifier to distinguish between the two classes by plotting the ROC curve. A higher AUC-ROC indicates better discriminative power of the model. Scikit-Learn's roc_auc_score function allows easy computation of AUC-ROC for binary classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next part, we will explore other evaluation metrics commonly used in regression and classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to practice calculating AUC-ROC using Scikit-Learn's roc_auc_score function with different binary classifiers. Compare the AUC-ROC values to assess the performance of the models on your dataset."
