    "### Part 1: Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we will explore the concept of Accuracy, a widely used evaluation metric for classification models. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions among all the predictions made by the model. Understanding Accuracy is crucial for evaluating the performance of classification models. Let's dive in!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Understanding Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy is a metric used to evaluate the performance of classification models. It measures the proportion of correctly classified instances (both true positives and true negatives) among all the instances in the dataset. The formula for Accuracy is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Accuracy = \\frac{\\text{Total Number of Predictions}}{\\text{Number of Correct Predictions}}$\n",
    "â€‹\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $Number of Correct Predictions$ is the number of instances correctly classified by the model.\n",
    "- $Total Number of Predictions$ is the total number of instances in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Interpreting Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy is generally easy to interpret, and a higher accuracy score indicates better model performance. However, it may not be the best metric when dealing with imbalanced datasets, where the number of instances in different classes is significantly different. In such cases, other evaluation metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-score may provide a more comprehensive assessment of the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Using Accuracy in Scikit-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn provides the accuracy_score function to calculate Accuracy. Here's an example of how to use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assuming y_true and y_pred are the true and predicted labels, respectively\n",
    "accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy is a fundamental evaluation metric for classification models. It measures the proportion of correctly classified instances among all instances in the dataset. A higher Accuracy indicates better model performance in terms of correct predictions. Scikit-Learn's accuracy_score function allows easy computation of this metric for classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next part, we will explore other evaluation metrics commonly used in regression and classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to practice calculating Accuracy using Scikit-Learn's accuracy_score function with different classification models. Compare the Accuracy scores to assess the performance of the models on your dataset."
