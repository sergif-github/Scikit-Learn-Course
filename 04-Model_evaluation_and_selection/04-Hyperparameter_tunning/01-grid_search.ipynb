    "### Part 1: Grid Search\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we will explore Grid Search, a powerful technique used to fine-tune the hyperparameters of machine learning models. Grid Search systematically searches through a predefined hyperparameter grid to find the best combination of hyperparameters that optimize the model's performance. Understanding Grid Search is crucial for optimizing the performance of machine learning models. Let's dive in!\n",

    "### 1.1 Understanding Grid Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameters are parameters that are not learned during model training and need to be set before training begins. Selecting the best hyperparameters can significantly impact the model's performance. Grid Search automates the process of finding the optimal hyperparameters by exhaustively searching through a specified set of hyperparameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the hyperparameter grid: Create a dictionary containing hyperparameter names as keys and lists of possible values as values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a model: Choose the machine learning model and set it up with default hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Initialize Grid Search: Use Scikit-Learn's GridSearchCV class to set up Grid Search with the chosen model and hyperparameter grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Perform Grid Search: Fit the GridSearchCV object on the training data, and it will perform cross-validation using each combination of hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Get the best hyperparameters: After Grid Search is complete, you can access the best hyperparameters using the best_params_ attribute of the GridSearchCV object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Using Grid Search in Scikit-Learn\n",
    "Scikit-Learn provides the GridSearchCV class, which can be used to perform Grid Search. Here's an example of how to use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n",
    "from sklearn.svm import SVC\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assuming X_train and y_train are the training data and labels, respectively\n",
    "param_grid = {'C': [0.1, 1, 10], 'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf']}\n",
    "model = SVC()\n",
    "grid_search = GridSearchCV(model, param_grid, cv=5)\n",
    "grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the best hyperparameters\n",
    "best_params = grid_search.best_params_\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are performing Grid Search on an SVM model with two hyperparameters: C and kernel. The hyperparameter grid param_grid contains possible values for C and kernel. The GridSearchCV object is then fit to the training data using 5-fold cross-validation (cv=5). After the Grid Search is complete, we can access the best hyperparameters using the best_params_ attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid Search is a powerful technique for fine-tuning the hyperparameters of machine learning models. It automates the process of searching through a specified hyperparameter grid to find the best combination of hyperparameters that optimize the model's performance. Scikit-Learn's GridSearchCV class makes it easy to perform Grid Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next part, we will explore other evaluation and selection techniques commonly used in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to practice Grid Search on your models. Experiment with different hyperparameter grids and see how it affects the model's performance. Grid Search is an essential tool for maximizing the potential of your machine learning models.\n",
