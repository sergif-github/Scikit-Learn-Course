    "### Part 4: Time Series Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we will explore Time Series Cross-Validation, a special type of cross-validation used for time series data. Time Series Cross-Validation is designed to assess the performance of machine learning models on time-ordered data, where the temporal order is crucial. Understanding Time Series Cross-Validation is crucial for evaluating the performance of models in time-dependent scenarios. Let's dive in!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Understanding Time Series Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "In time series data, the order of the observations matters. Traditional cross-validation techniques, such as K-fold Cross-Validation, assume that the data points are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.), which is not the case in time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Series Cross-Validation involves splitting the time series data into multiple folds while preserving the temporal order. Each fold contains a contiguous block of data points, which helps to simulate real-world scenarios where the model is trained on past data and tested on future data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Time Series Cross-Validation Strategies\n",
    "There are several strategies for performing Time Series Cross-Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Temporal Validation: In this strategy, we divide the data into two parts: the training set containing the past data and the testing set containing the future data. This approach is useful for forecasting and sequential prediction tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Rolling Window Cross-Validation: In this strategy, we create multiple overlapping windows of data, where each window contains a fixed number of time steps. The model is trained on the data within the window and tested on the next time step. This process is repeated, moving the window one step ahead each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Expanding Window Cross-Validation: Similar to Rolling Window Cross-Validation, but the size of the window increases with each step. This strategy allows the model to be trained on more data as the evaluation progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Using Time Series Cross-Validation in Scikit-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn provides the TimeSeriesSplit class, which can be used to perform Time Series Cross-Validation. Here's an example of how to use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit\n",
    "from sklearn.svm import SVR\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assuming X and y are the feature matrix and target vector, respectively\n",
    "tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5)\n",
    "clf = SVR(kernel='linear')\n",
    "scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y, cv=tscv)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, n_splits=5 specifies that we want to perform 5-fold Time Series Cross-Validation using the TimeSeriesSplit class. The model is trained and tested on time-ordered data, preserving the temporal order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Series Cross-Validation is a crucial technique for evaluating machine learning models on time series data. It allows us to assess the performance of models in time-dependent scenarios while preserving the temporal order of the data. Scikit-Learn's TimeSeriesSplit class makes it easy to perform Time Series Cross-Validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next part, we will explore other evaluation and selection techniques commonly used in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to practice Time Series Cross-Validation on your time series datasets. Experiment with different strategies, such as Temporal Validation, Rolling Window Cross-Validation, or Expanding Window Cross-Validation, to assess your model's performance effectively in time-dependent scenarios."
