    "\n",
    "## Part 3: Introduction to jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will introduce you to Jupyter Notebooks, a popular tool for interactive programming and data analysis. Jupyter Notebooks provide an interactive environment where you can write and execute code, view and visualize results, and document your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 What is jupyter notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Notebooks can contain both code cells and markdown cells. Code cells can be executed, and their output is displayed right below the cell. Markdown cells, like this one, are used for text explanations and documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Starting jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "To start Jupyter Notebook, open your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create or open a notebook. Then, run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "This command will start the Jupyter Notebook server and open the notebook interface in your default web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you can also choose to use an IDE, JupyterLab or Google Colab as we discussed in the previous chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Creating a new notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the notebook interface opens in your browser, you can create a new notebook by clicking on the \"New\" button and selecting \"Python 3\" (or any other available kernel) under the \"Notebook\" section. This will open a new notebook with an empty code cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 Working with notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter Notebook consists of a series of cells. Each cell can contain either code or markdown. To edit a cell, simply click on it. You can execute a code cell by clicking the \"Run\" button in the toolbar or by pressing Shift+Enter. The output of the code will be displayed below the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a new cell, you can click on the \"+\" button in the toolbar. By default, a new cell is created as a code cell. You can change the cell type to markdown by selecting \"Markdown\" from the dropdown menu in the toolbar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5 Markdown basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text in Jupyter Notebooks. It provides an easy way to add headings, lists, links, images, and other formatting elements to your notebook.\n",
    "Below are some basic Markdown formatting elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Headings:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\# Heading 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\## Heading 2\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\### Heading 3\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\#### Heading 4\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\##### Heading 5\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\###### Heading 6\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Emphasis:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\*Italic text* or \\_Italic text_\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \\**Bold text** or \\__Bold text__\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Unordered List:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\- Item 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\- Item 2\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\- Item 3\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ordered List:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\1. First item\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\2. Second item\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\3. Third item\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Links:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\[Link Text](https://www.example.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Images:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\![Alt Text]\\(image_url.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Blockquotes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\> This is a blockquote.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inline code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\`code`\n",
    "\n",
    "    Code block:\n",
    "    <pre>​```python\n",
    "    def function():\n",
    "        print(\"Hello, Markdown!\")\n",
    "    ​```\n",
    "    </pre>\n",
    "    \n",
    "8. Horizontal Rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\---\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Escaping Characters:\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you want to display special Markdown characters literally instead of using their formatting, use a backslash \\ before the character. For example, to display an asterisk *, use \\*.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the basic Markdown elements to get you started. Markdown supports many more advanced features like tables, task lists, and more. If you want to learn more about Markdown and its extended syntax, you can check out the official Markdown documentation or various online resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.6 Saving and closing notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "To save your notebook, click on the \"Save\" button in the toolbar or press Ctrl+S. This will save the notebook file with the .ipynb extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "To close a notebook, you can simply close the web browser tab or go to the \"File\" menu and select \"Close and Halt\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.7 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on learning the basics of Jupyter Notebooks! \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we will dive into previous machine learning concepts before diving into scikit-learn library."
