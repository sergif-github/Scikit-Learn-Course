    "# Module 0: Introduction to Scikit-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Installation and setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will walk you through the installation process and setup for Scikit-Learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Installing Scikit-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Scikit-Learn, you can use pip, the Python package installer. Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install scikit-learn`\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will download and install the latest version of Scikit-Learn from the Python Package Index (PyPI).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Checking the installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the installation is complete, you can verify if Scikit-Learn is installed correctly. Open a Python interpreter or Jupyter Notebook and import Scikit-Learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "    import sklearn\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the import statement executes successfully, it means Scikit-Learn is installed properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Installing dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn relies on other scientific libraries in Python, such as NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib. It's recommended to ensure that these dependencies are also installed in your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the dependencies, you can use the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "    pip install numpy\n",
    "    pip install scipy\n",
    "    pip install matplotlib\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to install the latest versions of these libraries to ensure compatibility with Scikit-Learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Setting up environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide a comprehensive environment for writing, editing, and running Python code. IDEs offer features such as code completion, debugging tools, and project management capabilities, making them popular among developers for efficient and productive coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Visual Studio Code, commonly referred to as VS Code, is a popular open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It offers a wide range of extensions and a big community, making it a powerful choice for Python development.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Install VS Code from the official website (https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "- PyCharm\n",
    "\n",
    "    PyCharm is a professional Python IDE developed by JetBrains. It offers a rich set of features specifically designed for Python development, including intelligent code completion, debugging tools, and support for various frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Download and install PyCharm Community Edition (free) or PyCharm Professional Edition (commercial) from the JetBrains website (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Atom\n",
    "\n",
    "    Atom is a customizable text editor developed by GitHub. It offers a vast ecosystem of packages and themes, making it a popular choice for Python developers who prefer flexibility and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Install Atom from the official website (https://atom.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples of the many IDEs available for Python development. Each IDE has its own set of features and workflows, so feel free to explore and choose the one that best fits your needs and preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using an IDE, you can streamline your Python development process, benefit from advanced code editing capabilities, and boost your productivity as a Python programmer. You will need to install extensions to work with .ipynb files used in this course. On the other hand, you can use JupyterLab or Google Cloab.\n",
    "\n",
    "- JupyterLab\n",
    "\n",
    "    JupyterLab is a powerful interactive development environment that allows you to create and run Jupyter notebooks, code, and markdown files.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Install JupyterLab with `pip install jupyterlab command`. Wait for the installation to complete. Once done, JupyterLab should be installed on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Launch JupyterLab by running the following command: `jupyter lab`. This will open JupyterLab in your default web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Google Colab (No Installations Required)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Alternatively, if you prefer a hassle-free setup without any installations on your local machine, you can utilize Google Colab. Google Colab provides a cloud-based environment where you can create, run, and collaborate on Jupyter notebooks without the need for local installations. Google Colab provides pre-installed libraries, including Python and popular data science packages like NumPy and Pandas. You can directly write and execute code in the notebook cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To access Google Colab:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Open Google Colab: Visit the Google Colab website using any web browser.\n",
    "    2. Create a New Notebook: Click on \"New Notebook\" to create a new blank notebook or choose from existing templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "With these installation steps completed, you're now ready to start using Scikit-Learn for machine learning tasks!\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing the installation and setup process for Scikit-Learn. In the next section, we will introduce Jupyter Notebooks."
