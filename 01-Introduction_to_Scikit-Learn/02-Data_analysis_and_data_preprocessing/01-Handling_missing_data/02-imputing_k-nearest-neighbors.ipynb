    "### Part 2: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we will explore the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation technique, which is used for handling missing data. KNN imputation fills in missing values by using the values from neighboring data points. Let's dive in!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Understanding K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation is a technique that estimates missing values based on the values of their nearest neighbors. It assumes that similar data points have similar feature values. The algorithm finds the K nearest neighbors of a data point with missing values and imputes the missing values using the average or weighted average of the neighbors' values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind KNN imputation is to leverage the similarity between data points to estimate missing values. By using the values of the nearest neighbors, the imputed values are expected to be closer to the true values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Training and Imputation\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply KNN imputation, we need a dataset with missing values. The algorithm identifies the nearest neighbors of each data point with missing values based on a distance metric, such as Euclidean distance. It then imputes the missing values using the average or weighted average of the neighbors' values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn provides the KNNImputer class for performing KNN imputation. Here's an example of how to use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.impute import KNNImputer\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an instance of the KNNImputer model\n",
    "knn_imputer = KNNImputer(n_neighbors=5)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fit the model to the data and impute missing values\n",
    "X_imputed = knn_imputer.fit_transform(X)\n",
    "\n",
    "# X_imputed now contains the imputed dataset with filled missing values\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Choosing Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The KNNImputer class has several important parameters that need to be set appropriately. The n_neighbors parameter determines the number of neighbors to consider when imputing missing values. Other parameters include the distance metric and weights used in the imputation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Handling Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN imputation is a powerful technique for handling missing data. However, it requires that the dataset has a sufficient number of data points with complete information to estimate missing values accurately. Additionally, the choice of K and the distance metric can have a significant impact on the imputation results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation is a useful technique for handling missing data. It estimates missing values based on the values of neighboring data points. Scikit-Learn provides the KNNImputer class for performing KNN imputation easily. Understanding the concepts, training, and parameter tuning is crucial for effectively using KNN imputation in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next part, we will explore other data preprocessing techniques provided by Scikit-Learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to practice implementing KNN imputation using Scikit-Learn. Experiment with different values for K and distance metrics to find the optimal imputation strategy for your dataset."
