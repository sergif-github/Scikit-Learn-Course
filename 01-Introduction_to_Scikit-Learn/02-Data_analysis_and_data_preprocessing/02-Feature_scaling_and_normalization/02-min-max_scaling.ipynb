    "### Part 2: Min-Max Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we will explore the concept of Min-Max scaling, a data preprocessing technique used to transform features to a specified range. Min-Max scaling is particularly useful when features need to be mapped to a specific range, such as between 0 and 1. Let's dive in!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Understanding Min-Max Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Min-Max scaling, also known as feature scaling or normalization, is a technique used to transform numerical features to a specified range. It involves linearly scaling the features to fit within a specific interval, typically between 0 and 1. Min-Max scaling preserves the shape of the distribution while mapping the minimum and maximum values to the specified range.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind Min-Max scaling is to bring all features to a common range, making them comparable and avoiding the dominance of features with larger magnitudes. It is particularly useful when the absolute values or ranges of features are important for the learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Training and Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply Min-Max scaling, we need a dataset with numerical features. The scaling process involves calculating the minimum and maximum values of each feature in the training set. We then linearly scale the feature values to fit within the desired range for both the training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn provides the MinMaxScaler class for performing Min-Max scaling. Here's an example of how to use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an instance of the MinMaxScaler model\n",
    "scaler = MinMaxScaler()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fit the model to the training data and calculate the minimum and maximum values\n",
    "scaler.fit(X_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Transform the training and test data using the calculated minimum and maximum values\n",
    "X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train)\n",
    "X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Choosing Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The MinMaxScaler class allows specifying the desired range for the scaled values through the feature_range parameter. By default, it scales the features to the range [0, 1]. However, you can also specify a different range if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Handling Different Ranges\n",
    "\n",
    "Min-Max scaling is particularly useful when features need to be mapped to a specific range, such as between 0 and 1. It brings all features within the desired interval, making them directly comparable. This is important for algorithms that are sensitive to the absolute values or ranges of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Min-Max scaling is a data preprocessing technique used to transform numerical features to a specified range. It brings features within the desired interval, making them directly comparable and avoiding the dominance of features with larger magnitudes. Scikit-Learn provides the MinMaxScaler class for performing Min-Max scaling easily. Understanding the concepts, training, and parameter tuning is crucial for effectively using Min-Max scaling in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next part, we will explore other data preprocessing techniques provided by Scikit-Learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to practice implementing Min-Max scaling using Scikit-Learn's MinMaxScaler. Experiment with different ranges and observe the effects on the feature distributions."
