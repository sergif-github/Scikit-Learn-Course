    "# Module 1: Introduction to Scikit-Learn\n",

    "## Section 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 3: Robust Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we will explore the concept of Robust scaling, a data preprocessing technique used to transform features by scaling them to be robust to outliers. Robust scaling is particularly useful when dealing with datasets that contain extreme values or outliers. Let's dive in!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Understanding Robust Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Robust scaling, also known as robust standardization, is a technique used to transform numerical features by scaling them based on robust statistics that are less affected by outliers. It involves subtracting the median and dividing by the interquartile range (IQR) of each feature. Robust scaling is designed to be resilient to the presence of extreme values and outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind robust scaling is to bring all features to a common scale while minimizing the influence of outliers. By using the median and IQR instead of the mean and standard deviation, robust scaling is less sensitive to extreme values and outliers, making it suitable for datasets with such characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Training and Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply robust scaling, we need a dataset with numerical features. The scaling process involves calculating the median and IQR of each feature in the training set. We then subtract the median and divide by the IQR for each feature in both the training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn provides the RobustScaler class for performing robust scaling. Here's an example of how to use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an instance of the RobustScaler model\n",
    "scaler = RobustScaler()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fit the model to the training data and calculate the median and IQR\n",
    "scaler.fit(X_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Transform the training and test data using the calculated median and IQR\n",
    "X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train)\n",
    "X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Choosing Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The RobustScaler class does not have any specific parameters to set. It automatically calculates the median and IQR based on the training data. However, it is important to apply robust scaling consistently to both the training and test sets to ensure that the scales are aligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 Handling Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "Robust scaling is particularly useful when dealing with datasets that contain extreme values or outliers. It is less affected by outliers compared to other scaling techniques that use the mean and standard deviation. By using robust statistics, the scaling process is more resilient to the presence of extreme values, allowing for better representation of the majority of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Robust scaling is a data preprocessing technique used to transform numerical features by scaling them based on robust statistics. It brings features to a common scale while minimizing the influence of outliers. Scikit-Learn provides the RobustScaler class for performing robust scaling easily. Understanding the concepts, training, and parameter tuning is crucial for effectively using robust scaling in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next part, we will explore other data preprocessing techniques provided by Scikit-Learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to practice implementing robust scaling using Scikit-Learn's RobustScaler. Experiment with different datasets, including those with outliers, and observe the effects on the feature distributions."
