    "# Module 1: Introduction to Scikit-Learn\n",

    "## Section 3: Supervised Learning Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1: Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will explore Linear Regression, one of the fundamental supervised learning algorithms used for predicting continuous numeric values. Linear Regression models the relationship between independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target) by fitting a linear equation to the data. Let's dive in!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Understanding Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the target variable. The equation of a simple linear regression model can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "y = b0 + b1 * x1 + b2 * x2 + ... + bn * xn\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- y is the target variable\n",
    "- x1, x2, ..., xn are the independent variables (features)\n",
    "- b0, b1, b2, ..., bn are the coefficients (slopes) of the linear equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fit line that minimizes the difference between the predicted values and the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Training and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a Linear Regression model, we need a labeled dataset with the target variable and the corresponding feature values. The model learns the coefficients (b0, b1, b2, ..., bn) by minimizing the residual sum of squares (RSS) or the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted and actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once trained, we can evaluate the model's performance using evaluation metrics such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n",
    "- R-squared (coefficient of determination)\n",
    "- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n",
    "- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Implementing Linear Regression in Scikit-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn provides the LinearRegression class for implementing linear regression models. Here's an example of how to use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an instance of the LinearRegression model\n",
    "model = LinearRegression()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fit the model to the training data\n",
    "model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Predict target variable for test data\n",
    "y_pred = model.predict(X_test)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluate the model's performance\n",
    "mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)\n",
    "r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Assumptions of Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression makes certain assumptions about the data. It assumes that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is a linear relationship between the independent variables and the target variable.\n",
    "- The residuals (the differences between the predicted and actual values) follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "- The residuals have constant variance (homoscedasticity).\n",
    "- There is no multicollinearity among the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Dealing with Nonlinear Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression assumes linearity, but sometimes the relationship between the features and the target variable is nonlinear. In such cases, we can use techniques like polynomial regression or other nonlinear regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6 Regularized Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle potential overfitting or multicollinearity issues, we can use regularized linear regression techniques such as Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression. These techniques add a regularization term to the cost function, which helps control the model complexity and prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.7 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression is a powerful and widely used algorithm for predicting continuous numeric values. It models the linear relationship between independent variables and the target variable. Scikit-Learn provides the LinearRegression class to implement linear regression models easily. Understanding the assumptions and limitations of linear regression is crucial for interpreting the results and making informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next part, we will explore another popular supervised learning algorithm, Logistic Regression, used for classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to practice implementing Linear Regression using Scikit-Learn. Experiment with different features and evaluation metrics to gain a deeper understanding of the algorithm and its performance."
