    "### Part 11: Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we will explore Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), a classification algorithm that relaxes the equal covariance assumption of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). QDA is useful when the class covariances are different, and it can capture more complex decision boundaries. Let's dive in!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11.1 Understanding Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) is a supervised learning algorithm that, like LDA, aims to find a linear combination of features that separates multiple classes. However, unlike LDA, QDA allows for different class covariances, making it more flexible and suitable for cases where the covariance structures differ significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "QDA models each class with its own covariance matrix, and the decision boundaries are quadratic curves. QDA can capture more complex decision boundaries than LDA and can be particularly useful when the class distributions are non-linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11.2 Training and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a QDA model, we need a labeled dataset with the target variable and the corresponding feature values. The model learns by estimating the class means and class covariances based on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once trained, we can evaluate the model's performance using evaluation metrics suitable for classification tasks, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn provides the QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis class for performing QDA. Here's an example of how to use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.discriminant_analysis import QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an instance of the QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis model\n",
    "qda = QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fit the model to the training data\n",
    "qda.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Predict class labels for test data\n",
    "y_pred = qda.predict(X_test)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluate the model's performance\n",
    "accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\n",
    "precision, recall, f1_score, _ = precision_recall_fscore_support(y_test, y_pred, average='binary')\n",
    "auc = roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred_prob)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11.3 Assumptions and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "QDA assumes that the class distributions follow multivariate Gaussian distributions and that each class has its own covariance matrix. It works best when the class distributions have different covariance structures and when the decision boundaries are non-linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11.4 Handling Imbalanced Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "QDA can be sensitive to imbalanced classes, where one class has significantly more instances than the others. Techniques like class weighting, adjusting the decision threshold, or using oversampling or undersampling methods can help address the issue of imbalanced classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11.5 Comparison with LDA\n",
    "\n",
    "QDA is similar to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in terms of finding a linear combination of features for classification. However, QDA relaxes the assumption of equal class covariances, allowing for more flexibility in capturing complex decision boundaries. LDA, on the other hand, assumes equal class covariances and results in linear decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11.6 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) is a useful classification algorithm that relaxes the equal covariance assumption of LDA and allows for different class covariances. It can capture more complex decision boundaries and is particularly useful when the class distributions have different covariance structures. Scikit-Learn provides the necessary classes to implement QDA easily. Understanding the concepts, training, and evaluation techniques is crucial for effectively using QDA in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next part, we will explore Gaussian Process models, a flexible and powerful class of probabilistic models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to practice implementing Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) using Scikit-Learn. Experiment with different evaluation metrics, handling imbalanced classes, and comparing it with LDA to gain a deeper understanding of the algorithm and its performance."
