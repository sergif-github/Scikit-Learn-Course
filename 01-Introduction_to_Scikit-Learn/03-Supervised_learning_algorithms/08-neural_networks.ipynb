    "# Module 1: Introduction to Scikit-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 3: Supervised Learning Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 8: Neural Networks using Scikit-Learn's Multi-Layer Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will explore Neural Networks using Scikit-Learn's Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a powerful algorithm for complex learning tasks. MLP is a type of artificial neural network that consists of multiple layers of interconnected nodes (neurons). Let's dive in!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.1 Understanding Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is a feedforward neural network architecture, where information flows from the input layer through one or more hidden layers to the output layer. Each layer consists of multiple interconnected neurons, and each neuron applies a non-linear activation function to the weighted sum of its inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "MLP can learn complex patterns and relationships in the data, making it suitable for a wide range of tasks, including classification and regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.2 Training and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "To train an MLP model, we need a labeled dataset with the target variable and the corresponding feature values. The model learns by adjusting the weights and biases of the connections between neurons using an optimization algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once trained, we can evaluate the model's performance using evaluation metrics suitable for classification or regression tasks, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, or area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn provides the MLPClassifier class for classification tasks and the MLPRegressor class for regression tasks. Here's an example of how to use them:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier, MLPRegressor\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an instance of the MLPClassifier or MLPRegressor model\n",
    "classifier = MLPClassifier()\n",
    "regressor = MLPRegressor()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fit the model to the training data\n",
    "classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Predict class labels or values for test data\n",
    "y_pred_classifier = classifier.predict(X_test)\n",
    "y_pred_regressor = regressor.predict(X_test)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluate the model's performance\n",
    "classification_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_classifier)\n",
    "regression_mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_regressor)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.3 Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "MLP models have several hyperparameters that can be tuned to improve performance. These include the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in each layer, the activation function, the optimization algorithm, the learning rate, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameter tuning can be performed using techniques like grid search or randomized search. Scikit-Learn provides tools like GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to efficiently search through the hyperparameter space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.4 Dealing with Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "MLP models can be prone to overfitting, especially when the model is too complex or when the dataset is small. Techniques like regularization (e.g., L1 or L2 regularization), dropout, and early stopping can help mitigate overfitting and improve generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.5 Scaling Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling features is important for MLP models, as it helps ensure that all features contribute equally to the learning process. It is recommended to scale the features to a similar range, such as using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler, before training the MLP model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.6 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is a powerful neural network algorithm for complex learning tasks. It consists of multiple interconnected layers of neurons and can learn complex patterns and relationships in the data. Scikit-Learn provides the necessary classes to implement MLP easily. Understanding the concepts, training, and evaluation techniques is crucial for effectively using MLP in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next part, we will explore AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting), another popular ensemble learning algorithm used for classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to practice implementing Neural Networks using Scikit-Learn's Multi-Layer Perceptron. Experiment with different architectures, hyperparameter settings, activation functions, and evaluation metrics to gain a deeper understanding of the algorithm and its performance."
