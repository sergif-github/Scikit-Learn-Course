    "# Module 1: Introduction to Scikit-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 3: Supervised Learning Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 4: Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will explore Support Vector Machines (SVM), a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. SVM aims to find the optimal hyperplane that maximally separates the classes or best fits the regression data. Let's dive in!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Understanding Support Vector Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machines are binary classification models that find the best hyperplane (decision boundary) to separate data points of different classes. The hyperplane is selected such that the margin between the classes is maximized. Support vectors are the data points that lie closest to the decision boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "For linearly separable data, SVM uses a linear kernel to find a linear decision boundary. However, SVM can also handle nonlinear relationships by using different kernels, such as polynomial or radial basis function (RBF) kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Training and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "To train an SVM model, we need a labeled dataset with the target variable and the corresponding feature values. The model learns the optimal hyperplane or decision boundary that separates the classes or best fits the regression data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once trained, we can evaluate the model's performance using evaluation metrics suitable for classification or regression tasks, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or mean squared error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn provides the SVC class for classification tasks and the SVR class for regression tasks. Here's an example of how to use them:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.svm import SVC, SVR\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an instance of the SVC or SVR model\n",
    "classifier = SVC()\n",
    "regressor = SVR()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fit the model to the training data\n",
    "classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Predict class labels or values for test data\n",
    "y_pred_classifier = classifier.predict(X_test)\n",
    "y_pred_regressor = regressor.predict(X_test)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluate the model's performance\n",
    "classification_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_classifier)\n",
    "regression_mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_regressor)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM models have several hyperparameters that can be tuned to improve performance. These include the choice of the kernel, regularization parameter C, kernel-specific parameters (e.g., degree for polynomial kernel, gamma for RBF kernel), and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the optimal combination of hyperparameters can be done using techniques like grid search or random search. Scikit-Learn provides tools like GridSearchCV to perform hyperparameter tuning efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Dealing with Nonlinear Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where the data is not linearly separable, SVM can utilize nonlinear kernels to transform the data into a higher-dimensional space where linear separation is possible. This is known as the kernel trick and allows SVM to handle complex nonlinear relationships between features and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.5 Handling Imbalanced Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with imbalanced datasets, where one class has significantly more instances than the others, SVM may produce biased models. Techniques like class weighting, using different penalties for errors, or employing specialized SVM algorithms like weighted SVM or one-class SVM can be used to handle class imbalance effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.6 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machines (SVM) are powerful supervised learning algorithms for classification and regression tasks. SVM aims to find the optimal hyperplane that separates the classes or best fits the regression data. Scikit-Learn provides the necessary classes to implement SVM easily. Understanding the concepts, training, and evaluation techniques are crucial for effectively using SVM in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next part, we will explore Naive Bayes classifiers, a family of probabilistic classifiers commonly used for classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to practice implementing Support Vector Machines (SVM) using Scikit-Learn. Experiment with different kernels, hyperparameter settings, and evaluation metrics to gain a deeper understanding of the algorithm and its performance."
