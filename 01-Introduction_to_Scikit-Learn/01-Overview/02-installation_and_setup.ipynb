    "# Module 1: Introduction to Scikit-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 1: Overview of Scikit-Leadn and its Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: Installation and Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will walk you through the installation process and setup for Scikit-Learn. Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Installing Scikit-Learn\n",
    "To install Scikit-Learn, you can use pip, the Python package installer. Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "        pip install scikit-learn\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    This command will download and install the latest version of Scikit-Learn from the Python Package Index (PyPI).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Checking the Installation\n",
    "Once the installation is complete, you can verify if Scikit-Learn is installed correctly. Open a Python interpreter or Jupyter Notebook and import Scikit-Learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python \n",
    "        import sklearn\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    If the import statement executes successfully, it means Scikit-Learn is installed properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Installing Dependencies\n",
    "Scikit-Learn relies on other scientific libraries in Python, such as NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib. It's recommended to ensure that these dependencies are also installed in your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To install the dependencies, you can use the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "        pip install numpy\n",
    "        pip install scipy\n",
    "        pip install matplotlib\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Make sure to install the latest versions of these libraries to ensure compatibility with Scikit-Learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Setting up Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "If you prefer using Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis and learning, you can install it using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "        pip install jupyter\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Once installed, you can start a Jupyter Notebook by running the command jupyter notebook in your command prompt or terminal. This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Importing Scikit-Learn\n",
    "In your Jupyter Notebook, start a new notebook or open an existing one. To begin using Scikit-Learn, import it at the beginning of your notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python \n",
    "        import sklearn\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "With these installation steps completed, you're now ready to start using Scikit-Learn for machine learning tasks!\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing the installation and setup process for Scikit-Learn. In the next section, we will dive deeper into the fundamentals of Scikit-Learn and its capabilities."
