    "### Part 3: Model-based Optimization (e.g., Bayesian Optimization)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we will explore Model-based Optimization, a sophisticated technique used to optimize hyperparameters by building a probabilistic model of the objective function. One of the popular methods for Model-based Optimization is Bayesian Optimization, which leverages probabilistic models to efficiently search for the optimal hyperparameters. Understanding Model-based Optimization is crucial for fine-tuning complex machine learning models with limited computational resources. Let's dive in!\n",

    "### 3.1 Understanding Model-based Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Model-based Optimization is an optimization strategy that uses a probabilistic model to predict the performance of different hyperparameter configurations. Bayesian Optimization, as one of the model-based methods, constructs a surrogate model of the objective function, often using Gaussian Processes. The surrogate model provides an estimate of the objective function and its uncertainty, which guides the search for the next set of hyperparameters to evaluate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind Bayesian Optimization is to balance exploration and exploitation. The surrogate model helps explore promising regions in the hyperparameter space and exploit areas likely to yield optimal performance. By making informed decisions about which hyperparameter configurations to evaluate next, Bayesian Optimization can find the optimal combination with fewer evaluations than exhaustive search methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Using Bayesian Optimization in Scikit-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform Bayesian Optimization in Scikit-Learn, we can use third-party libraries that provide Bayesian Optimization functionality. One popular library for Bayesian Optimization is scikit-optimize (also known as skopt). Here's an example of how to use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from skopt import BayesSearchCV\n",
    "from sklearn.svm import SVC\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assuming X_train and y_train are the training data and labels, respectively\n",
    "param_space = {'C': (0.1, 10.0, 'log-uniform'), 'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf']}\n",
    "model = SVC()\n",
    "bayes_search = BayesSearchCV(model, param_space, n_iter=50, cv=5)\n",
    "bayes_search.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the best hyperparameters\n",
    "best_params = bayes_search.best_params_\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are using BayesSearchCV from scikit-optimize to perform Bayesian Optimization on an SVM model with two hyperparameters: C and kernel. The param_space dictionary defines the search space for each hyperparameter, including the type of search space ('log-uniform' indicates a logarithmic scale). The n_iter parameter specifies the number of evaluations to perform. The BayesSearchCV object is then fit to the training data using 5-fold cross-validation (cv=5). After the Bayesian Optimization is complete, we can access the best hyperparameters using the best_params_ attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Model-based Optimization, particularly Bayesian Optimization, is a powerful approach for hyperparameter tuning when computational resources are limited. It constructs a probabilistic model of the objective function to efficiently search for optimal hyperparameters. Third-party libraries, such as scikit-optimize, provide convenient implementations of Bayesian Optimization in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next part, we will explore other evaluation and selection techniques commonly used in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to practice Bayesian Optimization with scikit-optimize on your models. Experiment with different search spaces and the number of iterations to find the best hyperparameters for your machine learning models. Bayesian Optimization is an advanced technique that can significantly improve the efficiency of hyperparameter tuning."
