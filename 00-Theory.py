# Types of learning
# Supervised learning       -> Input labeled data to predict labels of new data
# Unsupervised learning     -> Input no labeled data to learn patrons or structures.
#                              (Clustering, dimensionality reduction, data association)
# Reinforcement learning    -> Input states and actions to learn how to improve on best states and actions

# 
# Classification    ->      Identify which category and object belongs to (spam / not spam)
# Regression        ->      Predicting and attribute associated with and object (Price prediction)
# Clustering        ->      Automatic grouping of similar objects into sets (Customer segmentation)
# Model selection   ->      Comparing, validating and choosing parameters and models (Improve model accuracy)
# Dimensionality reduction  ->  Reducing the number of random variables to consider
# Pre-processing    -> Feature extraction and normalization (Transform input data)


# Scikit-learn is build on NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib
# Simple and efficient tool for data mining and data analysis
# Open source with very few restrictions (BSD licence)
