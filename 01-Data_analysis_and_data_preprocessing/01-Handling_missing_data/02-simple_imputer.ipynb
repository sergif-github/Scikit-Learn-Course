    "### Part 2: Simple imputer\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we will explore techniques for handling missing data by imputing values using the mean, median, most frequent values or constant. Missing data can occur for various reasons, and imputation allows us to estimate or replace the missing values based on the available data. Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Understanding imputation techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Imputation is the process of filling in missing data with estimated or substituted values. It is a common approach to handle missing values in a dataset. The choice of imputation technique depends on the nature of the data and the reasons for the missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Imputation with mean\n",
    "\n",
    "Imputing missing values with the mean is a simple and commonly used technique. It replaces the missing values with the mean value of the available data for the respective feature. It works only with a numeric fields. This method assumes that the missing values are missing at random and that the mean value is representative of the feature's distribution.\n",
